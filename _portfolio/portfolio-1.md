## Framework
CATMiP follows the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) principle and consists of several key modules: the *Asynchronous Multi-Agent Transformer (AMAT)*, *Collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (CSLAM)*, the* High-Level Processor*, and the *Low-Level Navigation Controller*.
These modules are implemented and utilized differently during the training and execution phases.
## Training
