## Framework
CATMiP follows the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) principle and consists of several key modules: the *Asynchronous Multi-Agent Transformer (AMAT)*, *Collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (CSLAM)*, the *High-Level Processor*, and the *Low-Level Navigation Controller*.
These modules are implemented and utilized differently during the training and execution phases.
## Training
Figure 1 (a) depicts the CATMiP architecture and data flow at time-step $t$ of a simulated training episode with full communication, where the *active* subset $i_{1:g}$ of the agents are obtaining new macro-actions (MAs). During mission execution, each agent generates MAs individually or together with other active agents in its communication neighborhood, as shown in Figure 1 (b).

At each time-step of the mission, agents are considered as active, inactive, or on standby. Inactive agents continue executing primitive actions generated by their current MA, but enter standby mode when their MA termination condition is met. Agents on standby remain at their current location, waiting a random number of time-steps to find other on-standby agents in their communication neighborhood in order to activate at the same time-step together and obtain their new MAs with one pass through the network. If an agent's maximum standby time is reached and no other on-standby agent was found in the neighborhood, it activates alone. Agents that update their MAs become inactive again.
