Co-developed and delivered a comprehensive course on self-driving vehicle systems, guiding students from manual driving, to assisted driving, and ultimately to fully autonomous driving. Integrated interdisciplinary knowledge across electric machines, drive systems, control systems, programming, signal processing, and optimization. Led lab sessions where students developed sensing, planning, control, and SLAM modules using a vehicle platform powered by NVIDIA Jetson Nano. Provided practical instruction in Linux OS, ROS, C++, Python, and hardware integration, working with LIDAR, RGB-D cameras, IMU, wheel encoders, and electric motors.
