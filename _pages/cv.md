Education
======
* Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, 2025 (expected)
* M.S. in Control Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, 2020
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, 2017

Work experience
======
* May 2021- **PhD Researcher**
  * McMaster University University
  * Developed a transformer-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework for distributed cooperative mission planning of a heterogeneous team of mobile robots, enabling asynchronous and scalable cooperation among robotic teams.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Shahin Sirouspour

* Sep 2021- **Teaching Assistant**
  * McMaster University
  * Co-developed and led lab sessions for the *Autonomous Electrified Vehicle System Engineering* and *Control Systems Design* courses, focusing on interdisciplinary topics such as electric machines, control theory, and sensor integration. My role involved instructing students on developing practical applications, including system control, programming in Python, C++, and Matlab, and hardware integration using platforms like ROS, NVIDIA Jetson Nano, and Simulink.
  * Supervisor: Dr. Shahin Sirouspour

* May 2022- **Undergraduate Mentorship**
  * McMaster University
  * Mentored undergraduate students in research projects, providing technical guidance on obstacle detection and multi-robot navigation on an f1tenth ground vehicle powered by Nvidia Jetson edge computers. My support extended to areas like integrating LIDAR and RGB-D cameras and implementing collaborative-SLAM in 3D simulation environments including Gazebo and Isaac Sim.
