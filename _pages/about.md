Welcome to my personal website! I'm Milad Farjad, a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at McMaster University, with a focus on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and mobile robotic systems. My research explores cutting-edge AI solutions for autonomous systems, particularly in the realm of collaborative robotics and self-driving technologies.


### Research Interests
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**: Developing AI models that enable teams of robots to work together in dynamic environments.
- **Robotics and Autonomous Systems**: Focusing on robot perception, motion planning, and control systems, particularly for autonomous vehicles and robotic teams.
- **Sim-to-Real Learning**: Applying reinforcement learning and AI techniques to bridge the gap between simulated environments and real-world robotics applications.

### What I Do
Currently, my research at McMaster revolves around building scalable, AI-first frameworks for autonomous systems, with real-world applications ranging from search-and-rescue robotics to autonomous driving. I'm also deeply involved in teaching and mentoring, helping the next generation of engineers develop practical skills in control systems, robotics, and AI.

### General Interest and Activites
- **Music**: I play bass guitar in our little [alternative rock band](https://youtube.com/@1297_), and we have performed several live shows in Toronto. Music is a great way for me to practice mindfulness, offering a healthy separation from anxiety and worry.
- **Languages**: I enjoy learning different languages (or at least words and phrases from them) and engaging with people from diverse cultures. In the past, I published translations of books and media from English to Farsi.
- **Dungeons and Dragons**: I find D&D a truly fascinating way to explore different perspectives and live alternate lives beyond my own. <sub>(hit me up for a one-shot)</sub>
- **Cats!**
