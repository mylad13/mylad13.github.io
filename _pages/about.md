I am a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at McMaster University, with a focus on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and mobile robotic systems. My research explores cutting-edge AI solutions for autonomous systems, particularly in the realm of collaborative robotics and self-driving technologies.


### Research Interests
- **Robotics and Autonomous Systems**: Interested in developing intelligent robots by focusing on robot perception, motion planning, and control systems. Particularly interested in robot-robot and human-robot cooperation, and developing RL and MARL-based solutions.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Investigating AI-driven solutions for safe, scalable, and efficient self-driving technologies, including perception, sensor fusion, path planning, and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles operating in real-world conditions.

### What I Do
Currently, my research at McMaster revolves around building scalable, reinforcement-learning-based frameworks for autonomous systems, with real-world applications ranging from search-and-rescue robotics to autonomous driving. I am also involved in teaching and mentoring, helping engineering students develop practical skills in control systems, robotics, and AI. Check out my [Publications](https://mylad13.github.io/publications/) and [Portfolio](https://mylad13.github.io/portfolio/) pages.

### General Interest and Activites
- **Music**: I play bass guitar in an alternative rock band, and we have performed several live shows in Toronto. Playing music is a way for me to practice mindfulness, offering a healthy separation from anxiety and worry.
- **Languages**: I enjoy learning different languages and engaging with people from different cultures. I have published a number of translations of books and media from English to Farsi.
- **Dungeons and Dragons**: I find D&D a truly fascinating way to explore different perspectives and live alternate lives beyond my own. It's a unique way to practice quick and outside-the-box thinking.
- **Cats!**
