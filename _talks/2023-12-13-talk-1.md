I had the opportunity to present a three-minute introduction to my PhD thesis before my colleagues and professors at McMaster University and representatives from the Hamilton community. The challenge was to present complex research in an accessible and compelling way with the assistance of only a static slide.

I am grateful for being awarded the Chair's Commendation for an Outstanding Presentation, and would like to thank all the people involved in helping the presenters prepare and polish their talks!

My project is developing a unified transformer-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for training a heterogeneous team of mobile robots. The team can be a combination of ground and air vehicles with different sensors and capabilities, and will be able to operate in an asynchronous and decentralized manner in cooperative missions such as search and rescue, building inspection, military operations, etc.
